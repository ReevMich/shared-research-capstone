You will have to have git or the GitHub desktop installed on your computer in order to do that. Then you would clone this repository on your computer and create the folders and rename documents, then commit those changes. Then, you need to push any number of commits you made back to the main GitHub server.

Prof. Bonakdarian will go over Git and Github with the class i believe, but if you want to try learning ahead of time, I will provide some steps to get you started.

Here is what is would recommend for beginners to GitHub Desktop Application, given using the git command line would be the more versatile approach. ( Prof. Bonakdarian would agree. ;) )  However, GitHub desktop does include git command line if you want to use it at a later date.

So here is a little tutorial i wrote up on how to achieve what you are wanting to do.

Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop
======

https://desktop.github.com/

### Once installed enter your github credentials

### Once you're done with setup you should get this screen, i recommend doing the tour through the application.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
======

### Do so by clicking the plus sign in the top left of the application -> then click the clone tab, and you should see all the repositories you are a part of. -> Select "Preventative-Maintenance" or anything that looks like it; You might see "reevmich/Preventative-Maintenance".

### This is what you should get after you clone the repository (added some graphical descriptions)

### In that window that pops up you can create folders and structure files and what not. As you are making changes to the "Local" repo location you will notice GitHub Desktop being able to notice what changes were made.

Step 4: Go to Preventative-Maintenance git location
======

### Once you are done making changes to the local repo, go back to GitHub desktop, and commit.
